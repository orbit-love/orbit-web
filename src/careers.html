  <h2>About us</h2>
  <p>
    ðŸ‘‹ Hi! Here's a little bit about us.
    <a href="http://orbit.love">Orbit</a> is building tools for developer
    community builders. Our users include companies like Apollo, CircleCI,
    Buoyant, Nuxt.js, and Typeform. Our philosophy is based on the
    <a href="https://github.com/orbit-love/orbit-model">Orbit Model</a>, an open
    source framework for community building and measurement that we maintain.
  </p>
  <p>
    We're a thoughtful team with an action bias, and are backed by an amazing
    group of angels and investors including
    <a href="https://www.heavybit.com/">Heavybit</a>,
    <a href="https://www.harrisonmetal.com/">Harrison Metal</a>,
    <a href="https://twitter.com/JamesTamplin">James Tamplin</a>,
    <a href="https://twitter.com/sramji">Sam Ramji</a>,
    <a href="https://twitter.com/sonicaghi">Aghi Marietti</a>, and more.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our company is distributed with team members in Paris and San Francisco. All
    roles are remote-friendly. We value thoughtfulness, kindness, diversity,
    persistence, and curiosity. We think space puns are out of this world.
  </p>
  <p>
    The opportunities listed below include full-time positions, project work,
    and community contribution opportunities. Please view the page of each
    opportunity to learn more about it.

    members to be help guide and give input to these projects.

      <strong>Oh, and one more thing.</strong> If you could really see yourself
      at Orbit but don't see a role that fits what you're looking for... please
      still let us know. Needs change fast. We're open minded. And sometimes the
      stars, they just align. ðŸŒ
