  <h2>Tune-in to Episode One with Charlie Ward</h2>
    Our inaugural guest is <a href="https://twitter.com/charlierward">Charlie Ward</a>, founder of <a href="https://weekendclub.co/">Weekend Club</a>. What started as a casual meet-up in a London pub has now evolved into an online co-working community that helps keep Indie Hackers accountable. We'll dive into:
    <ul>
     <li>the idea behind the community</li>
     <li>how Charlie got his first members</li>
     <li>how he went from $0 to $2k MRR</li>
     <li>the challenges of running a paid community alongside a day job</li>
   </ul>
  <a href="https://discord.orbit.love">Join us live on Discord</a> on April 15 at 9 am PST. We'll be taking questions on the day.
